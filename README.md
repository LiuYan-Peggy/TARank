# A Graph Transerval Approach to Identify Influential Nodes in a Network<br>

## Introduction<br>
TARank addresses the influential node identification issue from a graph traversal perspective, which is totally different from existing methods in the literature. Meanwhile, it provides a general framework for influential node quantification, in which any existing centrality measures can be utilized for generating the final importance score. 

## Usage<br>
Implementation of TARank is available in Python 3.6.<br>

Import the python code into Pycharm, and then load some datasets to test. By the way, the centrality score dict and the parameter k also could be user-specific. Here, we set k=2 and use closeness centrality for generating the initial scores. After that complie and run the code. Finally, the result will be obtained.<br>

In addition, we also provide 53 networks which are used in experiments.
